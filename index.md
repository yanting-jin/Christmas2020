# Welcome to Blueberry Castle for Christmas 2020

Here are some short stories, lovely images, and happy songs that we cheris for counting down the Christmas at Blueberry Castle. We do it as a celebration to enrich our spiritual world, In fact, this online form of celebration is created to avoid agonising ourselves too much about what gifts we shall buy for each other and falling into the over-shopping mode. We think this way is more eternal and cherishable. 

Remember in the old days, we count day the dates by singing:
' On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me,
  a patrige on the pear tree..'


Hope you enjoy the Christmas as we do :)
